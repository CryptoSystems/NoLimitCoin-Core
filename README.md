What is NoLimitCoin?
----------------

NoLimitCoin (NLC2) is the exclusively listed Cryptocurrency used to power our No Limit Fantasy Sports Platforms. NoLimitCoin has super-fast and near instant transaction times and Ultra Low Transaction Fees. NLC2 is a Proof of Stake coin which pays out 4% per year in extra coins for staking and holding the coins in a local wallet. NLC2 allows us to have the lowest rake fees of any fantasy sports platform, we have cut rake fees by up to 50% over our competitors.

NoLimitCoin has been perfectly designed for a wide range of (gaming) applications because of its super fast transaction time and low fees. Our own fantasy sports platform www.cryptofantasysports.com and no rake poker platform www.nolimitcoinpoker.com are powered by NoLimitCoin. We are the first online platform to harness an efficient blockchain technology that introduced a cryptocurrency to (Daily) Fantasy Sports. 

Fantasy sports has exploded in popularity and is now played by nearly 60 million people in just the U.S. and Canada alone. This $7.2 billion dollar industry has gained significant traction over the last few years mainly due to the introduction of Daily Fantasy Sports (“DFS”), with the average player spending increasing from $5 on DFS in 2012 compared to $318 in 2016.
