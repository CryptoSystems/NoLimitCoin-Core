Mac OS X NoLimitCoind build instructions
Laszlo Hanyecz <solar@heliacal.net>
Douglas Huff <dhuff@jrbobdobbs.org>


See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building NoLimitCoin QT, the
graphical user interface.

Tested on 10.5 and 10.6 intel.  PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer I think it comes on the DVD
but you can get the current version from http://developer.apple.com


1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone git@github.com:NoLimitCoin/Nolimitcoin-Core.git NoLimitCoin

2.  Download and install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

2a. (for 10.7 Lion)
    Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf and uncomment "build_arch i386"

3.  Install dependencies from MacPorts

sudo port install boost db48 openssl miniupnpc

Optionally install qrencode (and set USE_QRCODE=1):
sudo port install qrencode

4.  Now you should be able to build NoLimitCoind:

cd NoLimitCoin/src
make -f makefile.osx

Run:
  ./NoLimitCoind --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./NoLimitCoind -daemon # to start the NoLimitCoin daemon.
Run
  ./NoLimitCoind help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands



Static Building
---------------
the following steps needs to be taken in order to build the QT wallet statically, so that the libraries are linked statically to the application. The wallet can be successfully built with version 5.4.2 of QT
Refer: https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.4/5.4.2/

1. Download QT from source
2. Build the QT Library
	# ./configure -release -opensource -confirm-license -static -no-sql-sqlite -no-opengl -qt-zlib -no-gif -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -no-openssl -no-dbus -no-audio-backend -nomake examples
3. Make QT
	# make -j 4
	where 4 is the number of cores your system has.
4. Use MacDeployQT to buid a .dmg bundle of your wallet
	# cd Qt5.4.2/5.4/clang_64/bin
	# ./macdeployqt ~/nlc/Nolimitcoin-Blockchain/release/NoLimitCoin-Qt.app -dmg

Troubleshooting
---------------
Troubleshoot some of the errors you might face.

Error: ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 
Solution:
	* Uninstall boost from macports 
	* Install boost from homebrew
